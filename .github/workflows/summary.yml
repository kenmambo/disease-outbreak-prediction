        ## 🎯 Quick Actions
        
        ### 🤖 Model Training
        ```bash
        uv run python -m disease_outbreak_prediction.train
        ```
        
        ### 🖥️ Launch Dashboard
        ```bash
        uv run streamlit run disease_outbreak_prediction/dashboard/app.py
        ```
        
        ### 🧪 Run Tests
        ```bash
        uv run pytest
        ```
        
        ## 📈 Performance Metrics
        
        Latest model performance (updated daily):
        - **LSTM Accuracy**: Check latest monitoring run
        - **Random Forest Accuracy**: Check latest monitoring run
        - **Training Data**: 11 years (2010-2020)
        - **Response Time**: <2 seconds
        
        ## 🔔 Recent Activity
        
        Check the [Actions tab](https://github.com/${{ github.repository }}/actions) for the latest workflow runs.
        
        ## 🆘 Troubleshooting
        
        ### Common Issues
        1. **Model Loading Errors**: Ensure models are trained first
        2. **Dashboard Not Starting**: Check Streamlit installation
        3. **Test Failures**: Review dependency versions
        
        ### Quick Fixes
        - Retrain models: Use "Model Performance Monitoring" workflow
        - Update dependencies: Use "Dependency Updates" workflow  
        - Rebuild docs: Use "Documentation" workflow
        
        ## 📊 Workflow Health
        
        - ✅ **Automated Testing**: Multi-platform CI/CD
        - ✅ **Performance Monitoring**: Daily model evaluation
        - ✅ **Security Scanning**: Automated vulnerability checks
        - ✅ **Documentation**: Auto-generated and deployed
        - ✅ **Dependency Management**: Weekly update checks
